# WonderDam
WonderDam is a combination of Wonderland model and ResOS reservoir optimisation model.
The Wonderland part predicts water usage and ResOS does the actual optimisation.
A code for drawing reservoir rule curves is available in /Rule_Curve.
In the current state, the program does not automatically link to ResOS and data import and export should be done manually.
This program is written as a part of my M.Sc. degree.
