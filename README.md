# WonderDam
WonderDam is a combination of Wonderland model and Hedging reservoir operation model.
The Wonderland part predicts water usage and Hedging does the actual optimisation.
A code for drawing reservoir rule curves is also available in the programme.
Use of SOP method is possible by tweaking the source code.
This program is written as a part of my M.Sc. degree.
